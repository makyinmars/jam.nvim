# jam.nvim

Search Spotify and control playback from a Telescope picker without leaving Neovim.

> [!NOTE]
> jam.nvim is an early preview. Spotify is the first provider; its provider-neutral
> core is designed for future Apple Music and YouTube Music adapters.

## Features

- Live, debounced Spotify search for tracks, albums, artists, and playlists
- Album and artist drill-down for browsing album tracks and artist top tracks
- Play, pause, skip, go back, and add tracks to the queue
- OAuth Authorization Code flow with PKCE—no client secret in your config
- Album-art previews through `image.nvim` or `chafa`, with automatic detection
- `:Jam` and `:Telescope jam` entry points
- Health diagnostics with `:checkhealth jam`

## Requirements

Required:

- Neovim 0.10+
- [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
- `curl` for Spotify API requests
- `openssl` for PKCE authentication
- A Spotify account and application client ID
- Spotify Premium and an active Spotify Connect device for playback control

Run `:checkhealth jam` after installation to verify these dependencies and your
configuration.

### Album artwork dependencies

Album artwork requires an optional renderer. Without one, the preview shows the
image URL as text.

- Install [`chafa`](https://hpjansson.org/chafa/) for a portable, full-color
  character-art preview
  (`brew install chafa` on macOS or `sudo apt install chafa` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- Or install [image.nvim](https://github.com/3rd/image.nvim) and use a compatible
  terminal such as Kitty or WezTerm.

`chafa` is the simplest cross-terminal option. Run `:checkhealth jam` to see
which artwork backend jam.nvim detected.

## Installation

### lazy.nvim

```lua
{
  "bautistaaa/jam.nvim",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
    -- Optional, for high-resolution artwork:
    -- { "3rd/image.nvim", opts = {} },
  },
  cmd = { "Jam" },
  opts = {
    providers = {
      spotify = {
        client_id = vim.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Native `vim.pack`

```lua
vim.pack.add({
  "https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
  "https://github.com/bautistaaa/jam.nvim",
})

require("jam").setup({
  providers = {
    spotify = { client_id = vim.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID },
  },
})
```

### mini.deps

```lua
local add = MiniDeps.add
add({ source = "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim" })
add({ source = "bautistaaa/jam.nvim" })
```

### packer.nvim

```lua
use({
  "bautistaaa/jam.nvim",
  requires = { "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim" },
  config = function()
    require("jam").setup({
      providers = {
        spotify = { client_id = vim.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID },
      },
    })
  end,
})
```

### vim-plug

```vim
Plug 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
Plug 'bautistaaa/jam.nvim'
```

Then call `require("jam").setup(...)` from your Lua config.

## Spotify setup

1. Create an application in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
2. Add `http://127.0.0.1:8765/callback` as an exact redirect URI.
3. Put the application's client ID in your shell environment:

   ```sh
   export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
   ```

   Add that line to `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, or the equivalent for your shell,
   then start Neovim from a new terminal. A client secret is not needed and
   should not be added to your configuration.
4. Install jam.nvim using one of the plugin-manager examples above.
5. Run `:checkhealth jam` and resolve any reported errors.
6. Run `:Jam auth spotify` and finish authorization in the browser.
7. Open Spotify and play something once so Spotify Connect marks the selected
   device as active.
8. Run `:Jam`, enter a search, and press `<CR>` to play a result.

Tokens are stored with `0600` permissions under Neovim's data directory. Run
`:Jam logout` to remove them.

### Troubleshooting

- **`Device not found`**: jam.nvim opens the selected item in Spotify. Once the
  app is ready, select the item again. If needed, manually play a track once so
  the Web API considers the device active.
- **Artwork URL instead of an image**: Install `chafa`, or configure `image.nvim`
  in a compatible terminal, then reopen the picker.
- **Client ID is not configured**: Confirm `:echo $SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` prints your
  client ID. Restart Neovim from a new terminal after changing your shell
  configuration.
- **OAuth redirect errors**: Confirm the redirect URI in Spotify is exactly
  `http://127.0.0.1:8765/callback`.

## Usage

```vim
:Jam                    " Open search
:Jam search             " Open search
:Jam auth spotify       " Connect Spotify
:Jam play
:Jam pause
:Jam next
:Jam previous
:Jam now-playing
:Jam logout
:Jam health
:Telescope jam
```

Search filters:

| Prefix | Searches |
| --- | --- |
| `a:` | Albums |
| `t:` | Artists |
| `s:` | Songs/tracks |

For example, `a:Abbey Road`, `t:BTS`, or `s:One More Night`. Queries without a
prefix search tracks, albums, artists, and playlists together.

Picker mappings:

| Mapping | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `<CR>` | Open an album/artist or play the selected track/context |
| `<C-q>` | Add selection to queue |
| `<C-p>` | Pause playback |
| `<Esc>` | Return from an album to the original search |

Selecting an album opens its tracks in disc and track order. Selecting an artist
opens their top tracks. Press `<Esc>` in either view to return to the same search
query.

## Configuration

```lua
require("jam").setup({
  provider = "spotify",
  search = {
    debounce_ms = 250,
    limit = 30,
    types = { "track", "album", "artist", "playlist" },
  },
  artwork = {
    enabled = true,
    backend = "auto", -- auto, image, chafa, text, or none
    width = 38,
    height = 16,
    cache = true,
  },
  picker = {
    layout_strategy = "flex",
  },
  providers = {
    spotify = {
      client_id = vim.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID,
      redirect_uri = "http://127.0.0.1:8765/callback",
    },
  },
})
```

## Provider design

Provider adapters declare capabilities and implement the common search and
playback interface. The Telescope UI does not call Spotify-specific endpoints,
so additional providers can expose only the capabilities their APIs support.

Apple Music and YouTube Music are not implemented yet. YouTube Music does not
offer an official public playback-control API, so that adapter will require a
carefully documented fallback rather than pretending all providers have equal
capabilities.
